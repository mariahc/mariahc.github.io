                            <p>My son goes to The Peek-a-Boo Daycare and he absolutely loves Miss Katie! Every morning he runs to the front door and begs us to take him to her house. Katie is fantastic with children, flexible with schedules, and highly trustworthy. She provides the children with a variety of games, crafts, educational activities, celebrations, animal interactions, and so much more! She even cooks delicious meals and snacks that even the pickiest eaters can't turn away. In addition to all those wonderful things, the kids have access to an outdoor play area that my son loves! We are fortunate to have found someone as spectacular as Miss Katie; I would recommend her to anyone looking for phenomenal daycare.</p><p>- John and Kay</p>

                            <p>We have had the best experience with our daughter at Peek-a-Boo daycare over the last three years. Katie is so loving, nurturing, and attentive, which has had such a positive impact on our daughter. She even asks to go to Katie's on the weekends! From all of the activities they do to the close friendships they have, we seriously couldn't have asked for a better daycare.</p><p>- Sophie</p>

                            <p>My Son had been with Katie at the Peek-a-Boo Daycare since he was 6 months old, he is now 4 years old and he is thriving! 
Katie's daycare is clean and safe. My child never wants to leave. Katie provides not only a fair and decent price for full or part time care, but she also includes home cooked meals for breakfast, lunch and snacks. 
His learning skills are amazing, in the 4 years he's been with Katie, she's helped with potty training, she's helped with learning his letters and numbers and colors and shapes and he is totally up to date for a 4 year old. Katie's indoor and outdoor activities I must say are amazing and my son is growing into a soon to be kindergartener and although we will hate to say good bye in 1 more year, we would love to see more children grow up and become amazing children by enjoying a spot at the Peek A Boo daycare. </p><p>- Jennifer</p>

                        <p>
                            Hi! My name is Katie. I began my day care journey in 2011 while still pregnant with my daughter. It's been an amazing experience since day one and I've been licensed and operating the peek-a-boo daycare ever since. Our typical day at peek-a-boo is filled with activities and fun. We do loads of arts and crafts. We make projects and games. We spend as much time outside as the weather allows. Outside we play on climbing structures, toy cars, tunnels, slides, bubbles, chalk, sensory table, and we love to do gardening projects where kids take home home-grown beans! We learn about all the bugs and animals we could come across in the backyard. All our days are filled with learning.

                            Please dress your child in clothes that are ready to be played in and get dirty. We don't always play clean. We love paint, chalk, pens, crayons, dirt, bubbles, slime, play-dough and more! Half the fun of sensory play is getting dirty. </p><p>

Hours of operation:<br> 
7am to 5pm Monday through Friday <br>
Lessons start after the last child arrives. We will have either morning music or an educational cartoon playing while kids arrive and get settled, in order to help kids enter into a calm, fun environment.
